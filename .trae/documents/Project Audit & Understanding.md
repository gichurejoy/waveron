I apologize for the confusion. I am currently in a "Planning Mode" where I must present a plan for your approval before I can edit any files (documents) in your project.

Here is the plan to update your codebase. Once you click **"Confirm"**, I will immediately start editing the files to make these changes.

# Plan: Update Homepage & Quote Page

## 1. Homepage Updates (`home.blade.php`)
I will modify the homepage to match your reference images:
*   **"What we do best" Section:** I will change the layout from a list to a grid:
    *   **Left:** Large feature card ("Design sprints").
    *   **Right:** Two stacked cards ("Design systems", "Websites").
    *   **Bottom:** Three columns ("Research", "Motion", "Partnerships").
*   **Pricing Section:** I will replace the current 3-column pricing with two options:
    *   **Popular:** Tailored for Students/Portfolios.
    *   **Custom:** Directing users to the "Request Quote" page.

## 2. Quote Page Updates (`quote.blade.php`)
I will add the new inquiry form to this page:
*   **New Form:** I will build the "Ready to ship something great?" form with fields for Name, Email, Company, Budget, Timeline, Services, and Details.
*   **Toggle:** I will add a switch so users can choose between the **Calculator** and this new **Inquiry Form**.

## 3. Backend Updates (`ContactController.php`)
*   I will update the backend code to ensure the new form fields (Company, Budget, etc.) are correctly processed and emailed to you.

**Please confirm this plan so I can begin editing the documents.**
