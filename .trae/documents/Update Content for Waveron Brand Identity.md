# Content Update Plan: Tailoring for Waveron

I will update the "Innovation" and "What we do best" sections in `resources/views/home.blade.php` to specifically reflect Waveron's identity as a digital agency (Software, Design, Branding, Marketing), replacing the generic "Quantum Labs" content.

## 1. Innovation Section Updates
I will rewrite the copy to focus on agency deliverables rather than generic SaaS features:
-   **Header:** Change "Driving Success with Quantum Labs" to **"Driving Success with Waveron"**.
-   **Large Card:** "Real-Time Performance Analytics" $\rightarrow$ **"Data-Driven Digital Strategy"** (Focus on ROI and user engagement).
-   **Small Card:** "Smart Automation Hub" $\rightarrow$ **"Agile Development Cycles"** (Focus on rapid delivery and sprints).
-   **Integration Card:** "Enterprise Integration" $\rightarrow$ **"Seamless Ecosystem Integration"** (Focus on connecting stacks like CRM/APIs).
-   **Security Card:** Keep "Advanced Security" but tailor the text to emphasize protecting client digital assets.

## 2. "What We Do Best" Section Updates
I will refine the service cards to map directly to Waveron's 4 core pillars:
-   **Design Sprints** $\rightarrow$ **"Full-Cycle Product Development"** (Software Development).
-   **Design Systems** $\rightarrow$ **"Brand Identity & Design Systems"** (Branding/Design).
-   **High-performance websites** $\rightarrow$ **"High-Performance Web Platforms"** (Web Development).
-   **Research & testing** $\rightarrow$ **"Market Research & Validation"** (Strategy).
-   **Motion & content** $\rightarrow$ **"Digital Marketing & Content"** (Marketing).
-   **Embedded partnerships** $\rightarrow$ **"Strategic Partnerships"** (Client Relationship).

I will ensure the specific "Waveron" tone—professional, innovative, and results-oriented—is applied throughout these updates while preserving the existing UI layout.
